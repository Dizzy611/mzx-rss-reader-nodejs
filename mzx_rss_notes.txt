figure out unhandled promise (certificate expired?)
check to make sure it's even reading/processing current feeds (see unhandled promise)


idea:

create feed class in feed.js, properties are:
	type : review, release, thread, or issue
	url : feed url
	channel : array of channel names to display feed in
	alternate_header : normally false, if true display instead of "**New on DigitalMZX**", "**For Approval**", for release feeds

require feed.js in config.js
instantiate feeds in config.js, assign to "feeds" array

feeds = [];
feed[0] = review, review url, mzx, false
feed[1] = release, release url, mzx, false
feed[2] = release, admin release url, digistaff, true
feed[3] = thread, thread url, mzx, false
feed[4] = issue, issues url, mzx-development, false
feed[5] = issue, requests url, mzx-development, false
